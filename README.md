This script is designed to keep your computer awake by simulating user activity. It moves the mouse slightly and presses a few keys at random intervals between 10 to 20 seconds to prevent the computer from going to sleep or locking the screen due to inactivity.

To run the script, you will need to first install some dependencies. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
python3 -m pip install pynput
pip3 install pyautogui
sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the script by executing the following command in the terminal:

```
python3 active.py
```
